                I'm on a mission to become a Quantum Algorithm/Software Engineer in the field of Quantum Computing. I'm driven and willing to go above and beyond to achieve my goals. </p>

             the home of the mighty panthers. VUU is in Richmond Virginia off N Lombardy St. 
             My undergraduate experience had a lot of experiences that I cherish dearly - I was a Computer Science Major on a 
             band scholarship. While studying at VUU, I was interested in software development and databases. As I got further into my studies,
             I then explored into the realms of quantum computing, which is where I'm at now academically. However, this would not be possible
             if it weren't for Mrs. Cole and the Marching Band: The Ambassador's of Sound. </p>

            text-align: center; padding:80px;">Being in the marching band was an experience where I can say it made me the person I
             am today. Band taught many life lessons that I still use, such as:<BR> 
                <span style="color:#d68706;"><i>"If you're early, you're on time, if you're on time, you're late, and if you're late, then you're forgotten."</i></span> <br>
                 One other lesson I could apply to the world of software development, is that<br> <u><b>Practice Makes Perfect!</b></u>
                </BR> On top of those lessons, band has also helped me grow as an individual and as a leader. I served as the Drumline section leader for the 2022-2023 season, 
                and as the Student Arranger for the drumline for the 2023-2024 season. While in these positions, I managed to lead, write music, teach, direct and really 
                help the band just as it helped me and I am greatful for that.</p>

                I served as Secretary 2021-2022, President 2022-2023, and Vice-president of Special Projects/Secretary/Focus on Five Liason 2023-2024. 
                During my time(s) serving on the Executive Board, I have learned a nultitude of skills from each office I've held, and have been able utilize them in my

            text-align: center;padding:80px;">As a Computer Science major at Virginia Union University, I was exposed to many different concepts that all intersected
            with one another. On top of that, I was able to learn a few coding languages in where I was able to apply what I was learning in my courses. It started with HTML/CSS/JS, 
            then to Python, and SQL/Relational Databases. Recently I've been learning Java and most notably Cirq. Cirq is Google's quantum lamguage for quantum software development.
            I began an Introduction to Quantum Computing Course in Fall 2023 with the organization "The Coding School - Qubit x Qubit", where I learned the basics of the language, and 
            the quantum concepts behind quantum computing. Below is my link to my Github profile!<br><span style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/Evalea4483">~Gwen's Github Profile~</a></span> </p>

                In the Fall of 2023, I was approached by my Universities IT director, and he offered me an internship in where I would be the project manager for an initiative in where
                we set up a location with computers and a network, to host workshops within the surrounding area on topics such as digital skills and digital literacy.
                This internship involved planning the logistics and designing the layout of the network and making sure the work is dvided up accordingly, 
                and is accomplished within the set schedule/time-frame.  </p>

            "VUU Alert" is an application me and another student decided to develop in order to better the communication between RA's and Students. Currently, the way the communcations are set up,
            is that students, RA's and housing directors are all in a GroupMe groupchat or groupchats via text message. Even though these may be good channels of communication, 
            it's not at all effective. Especially when it comes to documenting incidents or events that happen and require immediate response. 
            The main idea is - if there's an issue, the student would then be able to go to the app, click a button, and it will allow them to send a notification to the RA on duty,
            and the RA on duty (who has to be logged into the app while on duty) will then be able to see and repond the request more efficiently as well as everything being documented and saved in 
            our databases. This project is currently in it's early stages of development, but it is underway! </p>

                 with a focus on quantum algorithms and computation, as I am driven to become a quantum algorithms/software engineer some day. The road will be tumultuous, 
                 but I am more than prepared for the challenge as this is something I'm passionate about - utilizing quantum technologies/computation to better research in 
                 finding new physics discoveries. <br>

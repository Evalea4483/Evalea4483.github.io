                America in 1964 after fleeing from their countries, Czechoslavakia and Yugoslavia because of the communist regime that they were under after the second World War. 
                I'm on a personal mission to obtain success in the field of Information Technology, I'm driven and hungry for more, and I'm going to make this huge world my oyster! </p>

             the home of the mighty panthers. Hermitage is in Henrico Virginia off Hungary Spring Rd. 
             My highschool experience was definitely something, you always had drama, some stress, you know the usual things, 
             but one thing that really made it worth while was band. I'll never forget my first day of band camp under that 
             August Summer heat. </p>

            text-align: center; padding:80px;">Being in the marching band was an experience where I can say it made me the person I
             am today. Band taught many life lessons that I still use, such as:<BR> 
                <span style="color:#d68706;"><i>"If you're early, you're on time, if you're on time, you're late, and if you're late, you're screwed."</i></span> <br>
                 One other lesson I could apply to the world of technology, is that<br> <u><b>PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!!!</b></u>

            is an organization with a dedicated network of local high schools, colleges and businesses in which they provide
             crucial resources for promising students with limited means who have their sight set on a college education - and an ambitious career. 
             I was in 9th grade when I first heard of the program and decided to apply to get in, which I did. They helped prepare me for a lot of things 
             I was looking towards... going to college, a promising career... <span style="color:#d68706;">PFF has also offered me an internship at <br> 
                !!!<span style="font-size: 25px;"><i>Capital One</i></span> !!!<br>for the summer going into my Junior year of Highschool. There was no way I

            <p style="color:azure;margin:0;font-size: 20px;font-family: fantasy;text-align: center;padding:50px;">In the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity to intern at <stan style="color:dodgerblue">Capital</stan><stan style="color:red"> One</stan> and was paid!!! Going into it, I had no idea which department I was going into until the first day orientation.<stan style="color:#d68706"> I was going to be working on the IT side of things and my particular "pod" was <i>Enterprise Operations</i></stan>... Now to be honest I had no clue what exactly I was doing, but my manager, Iva MacFarland, lead me in the right direction and helped spark my interest in the tech field. <br><u>She taught me a lot on infrastructure, databases, what languages are used for such things, Iva made sure I learned a bit of SQL, HTML, CSS, and JS, and even informed me about Capital Ones switch over to the AWS cloud!</u> <br>This was my first job ever while in  public school, and I knew when I got older I wasn't going to settle for less. </p>

A lot of my decisions were purely based off what others may have wanted for me. So I went to college, struggling financially for music education while at the same time in the marching band at <stan style="color: maroon;">Virginia Union University</stan>... <stan style="color:#d68706;">I decided to leave VCU after one semester due to the fact I wasn't fortunate to pay out of pocket since financial aid thought my parents were making enough to help support me, but to be honest we were struggling big time and I had no choice but to leave.</stan> I loved music but I just felt so burnt out from highschool and I just didn't know if that was for me. SO after I left, I got a job and just worked while I tried to figure out what I was in to or at least try to find a different means of making my way in the world doing something I may enjoy.<stan style="color:#d68706;"> On the bright side, I left</stan><stan style="color: yellow;"> VCU</stan> <stan style="color:#d68706;">with a <u><b>3.56 GPA</b></u> so if I ever wanted to go back I could.</stan></p>

            <p style="color: azure; font-size: 20px; margin: 0; font-family: fantasy; text-align: center; padding: 20px;">Well, since VCU didn't go as planned, I needed to come up with a plan of attack. What was I supposed to do next??? I had plans of going into job corps for a trade, but because of that I wouldn't be able to march so I broke the news to Mrs. Cousins, the band director. Once I told her my situation, she was upset over the fact I was leaving and made the effort to help me out by offering a band scholarship. That is when I began my journey at <br> <stan style="color: maroon; font-size: 60px;">VUU</stan> <br><u>When classes began, I was still a freshman, I was on band scholarship, I am a student in the workforce development program and I am a Computer Information Systems major, Things are looking up for me right now and couldn't be</u><br><stan style="color: gold; font-size: 40px"> Happier</stan>

Because of my involvement with Work Force Development, I have the opportunity to have internship experience within my field. I also have the intentions of obtaining Solutions Architect certifications, as well as a Big Data Certifications in Amazon Web Services to further my interest in Cloud Computing. I also will be producing music and teaching drumlines on the side. <br>
